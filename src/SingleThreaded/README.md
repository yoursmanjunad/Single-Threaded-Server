# Single-Threaded Server

## Overview

This project implements a **single-threaded server** in Java. The server listens for client connections and processes requests sequentially in a single thread. It serves as a basic demonstration of network programming and socket handling.

## Features

- Listens for incoming client connections on a specified port.
- Handles requests sequentially (one at a time).
- Demonstrates fundamental socket programming in Java.
- Lightweight and easy to understand.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed (Java 8 or later).
- An IDE or command-line tools for compiling and running Java code.

## Installation & Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yoursmanjunad/Single-Threaded-Server.git
   cd Single-Threaded-Server
2. **Complie the Java Files:**
    ```
   javac src/SingleThreaded/*.java
   ```
3. **Run the Server:**
    ```
   java src.SingleThreaded.Server
   ```
